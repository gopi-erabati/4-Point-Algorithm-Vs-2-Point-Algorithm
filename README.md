# 4-Point-Algorithm-Vs-2-Point-Algorithm

Structure from Motion (SFM) is a hot topic now-a-days in computer vision. There are many classical SFM methods, and now the question is can we improve the classical methods including some prior knowledge. In this project I had worked on 8, 5, 4 and 2 point algorithms for estimation of essential and homography matrices.
